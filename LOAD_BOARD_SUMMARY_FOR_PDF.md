## 🗺️ Tracking & Trip Management — How It Works

1. **Load Assignment:**
   - As soon as a load is assigned, a tracking record is auto-created.
   - Origin and destination addresses are geocoded (lat/lng) using OpenStreetMap.
2. **Real-Time Location:**
   - Driver/trucker app sends current location to backend via API.
   - System updates `currentLocation` and timestamp in tracking record.
3. **Status Updates:**
   - Status can be updated to `in_transit`, `delivered`, etc. via API.
   - On delivery, trip is marked complete with end time.
4. **Trip Details:**
   - All trip info (origin/destination, live location, status, vehicle/shipment number, timestamps) can be fetched via a single endpoint.
